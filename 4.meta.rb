METAPROGRAMMING
 => Metaprogramming refers to the ability of a program to analyze, modify, or generate
 code at runtime. In Ruby, metaprogramming is a powerful feature that allows you 
 to write code that can create, modify, or extend classes, methods, and other 
 program constructs dynamically.
metaprogramming allows us to essentially write code that writes code

#   Example 2 - mass assignment

Mass assignment in Ruby refers to the practice of assigning multiple attribute 
values to an object in a single operation.

  """
  
  In the above example, we have a Studentnt class with three attributes: name, age, and email. By using 
  the attr_accessor method, we automatically create getter and setter methods for each attribute.

In the initialize method, we accept a hash of attributes as an argument. We iterate over each key-value 
pair in the attributes hash and use the send method to dynamically call the setter method for each 
attribute, setting its value.

By passing a hash of attribute values (name: "John", age: 25, email: "john@example.com") when creating
 a new Person object (Person.new(...)), we can easily assign multiple attribute values at once using 
 mass assignment.

This approach allows for concise and flexible initialization of objects with multiple attributes, 
reducing the amount of repetitive code required to set each attribute individually.

It's important to note that while mass assignment provides convenience, it can also introduce security risks if not handled properly. In scenarios where user input is used for mass assignment, it's essential to validate and sanitize the input to prevent malicious attacks like mass assignment vulnerabilities.
